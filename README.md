### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to the GeoChemFoam github. Here you will find links to the source code, precompiled dockers, jupyter notebook and video tutorials, users manuals, publications and more!


GeochemFoam is the world most advanced open source pore-scale numerical simulator based on OpenFOAM made specifically for researching pore-scale processes related to the energy transition. Below is a list of current capabilities, but we are always adding new stuff and we welcome contributions from the community. Drop us a line at GeoChemFoam@hw.ac.uk.

Current capabilities:
- Miscible Displacement (e.g. scCO2 dissolving in brine)
- Immiscible Displacement at low capillary number (e.g. drainage & imbibition of oil)
- Conjugate Heat Transfer (e.g. cold water injection into hot porous media)
- Reactive Dissolution (e.g. acid-well stimulation)
- Contaminant transport (e.g. plume migration)

Currently in development:
- Charge Balance
- On-demand machine learning for reaction with Reaktoro

We are looking to collaborate on:
- Precipitation
- Bubble nucleation
- Phase transition
- Wettability alteration
