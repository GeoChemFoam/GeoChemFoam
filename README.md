## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to the GeoChemFoam github! Here you will find links to the source code, precompiled dockers, jupyter notebook and video tutorials, users manuals, publications and more!

### The GeoChemFoam source code is hosted on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/HWUCarbonates/workspace/projects/GCF). A precompiled docker of the latest version is also available on the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jcmaes/geochemfoam).

GeochemFoam is the world most advanced open source pore-scale numerical simulator based on OpenFOAM made specifically for researching pore-scale processes related to the energy transition. Below is a list of current capabilities, but __we are always adding new stuff and we welcome contributions from the community.__ Drop us a line at GeoChemFoam@hw.ac.uk.

#### __Current capabilities:__
- Miscible Displacement (e.g. scCO2 dissolving in brine)
- Immiscible Displacement at low capillary number (e.g. drainage & imbibition of oil)
- Conjugate Heat Transfer (e.g. cold water injection into hot porous media)
- Reactive Dissolution (e.g. acid-well stimulation)
- Contaminant transport (e.g. plume migration)
- Darcy-Stokes-Brinkman (e.g. permeability upscaling)

#### __Currently in development:__
- Charge Balance
- On-demand machine learning for reaction with Reaktoro

#### __We are looking to collaborate on:__
- Precipitation
- Bubble nucleation
- Phase transition
- Wettability alteration
