## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to the GeoChemFoam github! Here you will find links to the source code, precompiled dockers, jupyter notebook and video tutorials, [a users wiki](https://github.com/GeoChemFoam/GeoChemFoam/wiki), publications, a discussion forum and more!

### The GeoChemFoam source code is hosted on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/HWUCarbonates/workspace/projects/GCF). A precompiled docker of the latest version is also available on the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jcmaes/geochemfoam).

GeochemFoam is the world most advanced open source pore-scale numerical simulator based on OpenFOAM developed at the Institute for GeoEnergy Engineering at Heriot-Watt University. GeoChemFoam is made specifically for researching pore-scale processes related to the energy transition. Below is a list of current capabilities, but __we are always adding new stuff and we welcome contributions from the community.__ Drop us a line at GeoChemFoam@hw.ac.uk.

#### __Current capabilities:__
- Multiphase Reactive Transport (e.g. [scCO2 dissolving in brine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03579.pdf))

- Improved Multiphase solver (e.g. [benchmarking viscous fingering in a micromodel](https://github.com/GeoChemFoam/GeoChemFoam/blob/main/GeoChemFoam_Papers/Zhaoetal2019_PoreScaleModels_PNAS.pdf))

- Two-phase flow at low capillary number (e.g. [drainage & imbibition of oil in brine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10576))

- Conjugate Heat Transfer (e.g. [cold water injection into hot porous media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03311))


- Reactive Dissolution (e.g. [acid-well stimulation](https://www.earthdoc.org/content/papers/10.3997/2214-4609.202035250))

- Contaminant transport (e.g. [plume migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03597))

- Darcy-Stokes-Brinkman (e.g. [permeability upscaling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82029-2))
